Do you offer help? Ignore the person? Here are a few tips on how to best handle the situation.</p>
<p>First, try to determine if the person is actually an addict. Many people enjoy playing casino games occasionally without any negative consequences. If the person is simply enjoying themselves and not detrimentally affected by their gambling, then there’s no need for concern. However, if the person appears to be struggling or unable to control their gambling, then they may be addicted.</p>
<p>If you determine that the person is an addict, your first instinct might be to confront them or try to help them. However, this may not be the best course of action. Addicts are often defensive and resistant to change, so it’s important to approach them in a non-judgmental way. Try to build a relationship of trust before you start trying to help them overcome their addiction.</p>
<p>You can also provide support in other ways. You can keep an eye on the person, make sure they’re safe and healthy, and provide a listening ear when they need it. It’s important to remember that addiction is a disease and not a choice, so addicts need understanding and compassion rather than judgement.</p>
