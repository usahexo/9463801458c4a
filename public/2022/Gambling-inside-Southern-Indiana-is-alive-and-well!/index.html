There are several casinos in the area, as well as numerous racetracks and off-track betting parlors.</p>
<p>The Belterra Casino Resort is one of the largest and most popular casinos in the region. It features more than 2,000 slot machines and 60 table games, including blackjack, roulette, and craps. The casino also has a hotel, spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>Just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, the Hollywood Casino is another major gambling destination in Southern Indiana. It has more than 1,700 slot machines and 50 table games. The casino also has a hotel, restaurants, and a night club.</p>
<p>There are also several smaller casinos scattered throughout Southern Indiana. These include the Blue Chip Casino in Michigan City, the Tropicana Evansville Casino, and the Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino.</p>
<p>In addition to casinos, there are also several racetracks in Southern Indiana. The most prominent of these is the Hoosier Park Racing &amp; Casino in Anderson. The track offers live racing every week from April through November and features more than 1,500 slot machines and 30 table games.</p>
<p>There are also numerous off-track betting (OTB) parlors throughout Southern Indiana. These establishments allow bettors to place bets on races that are taking place at tracks around the country. The OTB parlor in Clarksville is perhaps the most popular in the region, with more than 80 televisions showing live racing from around the country.</p>
<h1 id="Is-gambling-an-addiction-Southern-Indiana-residents-say-yes"><a href="#Is-gambling-an-addiction-Southern-Indiana-residents-say-yes" class="headerlink" title="Is gambling an addiction? Southern Indiana residents say yes!"></a>Is gambling an addiction? Southern Indiana residents say yes!</h1><p>Southern Indiana residents are in agreement that gambling is an addiction. Gambling addictions can have negative consequences on individuals, families, and communities.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun activity for some people, but for others, it can lead to serious problems. Those who gamble excessively are at risk for developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can destroy lives. It is characterized by a strong urge to gamble and an inability to resist the temptation to gamble.</p>
<p>People with gambling addiction may lose large sums of money, lie to cover up their gambling activities, or experience dramatic mood swings as a result of their addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can cause significant financial problems for the addict and his or her family. It can also lead to job loss, financial ruin, and homelessness.</p>
<p>The social effects of gambling addiction can be just as devastating as the personal effects. Gambling addicts often withdraw from friends and family members and become isolated from the community.</p>
<p>They may also engage in criminal activity in order to get money to gamble with. Gambling addiction can have a negative impact on the economy of a community as well.</p>
<p>If you think you or someone you know may be suffering from a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. There are many resources available for those who need help dealing with this problem.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-taking-over-lives-of-southern-Indiana-residents"><a href="#Gambling-taking-over-lives-of-southern-Indiana-residents" class="headerlink" title="Gambling taking over lives of southern Indiana residents"></a>Gambling taking over lives of southern Indiana residents</h1><p>Gambling has become a huge issue in southern Indiana, where many residents are struggling with addiction to various forms of the activity. Casinos, race tracks, and other gambling venues are all popular tourist destinations in the area, and many people have lost everything they have due to their gambling addictions.</p>
<p>There are several support groups available for those affected by gambling addiction in southern Indiana, but most of these groups are not well known. In addition, there are very few resources available to help people pay for treatment for their addiction. This is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to help the people who are struggling with this problem.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a devastating effect on people’s lives. Not only do addicted individuals lose money that they can’t afford to lose, but they also often lose relationships with friends and family members.

<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-in-southern-Indiana"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-on-the-rise-in-southern-Indiana" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction on the rise in southern Indiana"></a>Gambling addiction on the rise in southern Indiana</h1><p>Gambling addiction is on the rise in southern Indiana. According to a recent study published by Ball State University, the number of people seeking help for gambling addiction has quadrupled in the past six years.</p>
<p>Many people are drawn to gambling because of the potential for big winnings. However, what begins as a recreational activity can quickly become an addiction. Gambling can be addictive because it stimulates the brain’s reward system. This system is responsible for providing us with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Gambling can also be addictive because it offers a sense of control and power. People with gambling addiction often feel like they are in charge of their own destiny. They believe that they can make up for any losses through their next bet.</p>
<p>Some people gamble to escape from problems or stress in their lives. Gambling can provide a temporary high that allows them to forget about their troubles for a while. Unfortunately, this high is usually followed by feelings of guilt and shame.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, there is help available. There are several addiction treatment centers in southern Indiana that can help you get back on track.</p>
<h1 id="Southern-Indiana-residents-hooked-on-gambling"><a href="#Southern-Indiana-residents-hooked-on-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Southern Indiana residents hooked on gambling"></a>Southern Indiana residents hooked on gambling</h1><p>Southern Indiana residents are increasingly turning to gambling as a way to escape their daily lives and problems, according to experts.</p>
<p>“Gambling is an addiction that provides short-term relief from boredom, stress and other problems, but it ultimately leads to more pain and difficulties,” said Dr. William Thornton, a clinical psychologist who specializes in addiction.</p>
<p>Indiana’s high poverty rate – the fifth highest in the nation – is a major factor driving people to gamble, Thornton said.</p>
<p>“People living in poverty are more likely to experience stress and anxiety, which can lead to pathological gambling,” he said.</p>
<p>According to the Indiana Gaming Commission, the state’s casinos generated $2.3 billion in revenue in 2017, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year.</p>
<p>Much of that increase is attributable to gambling by Hoosiers living in Southern Indiana. The three casinos located south of Indianapolis – Belterra Park Casino Resort in Florence; Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg; and Rising Star Casino Resort in Rising Sun – took in nearly $1.2 billion last year, up from $1.1 billion in 2016.</p>
<p>That amounts to nearly half of all casino revenue generated by the state’s 10 casinos.</p>
<p>Casino officials say they’re not surprised by the trend.</p>
<p>“We continue to see growth from our customer base in Southern Indiana as well as from those traveling from Louisville and Cincinnati,” said Bob Duchossois, CEO of Churchill Downs Inc., which owns Belterra Park.</p>
<p>The growth of casino gaming across the United States has been nothing short of explosive over the past two decades. From just 44 commercial casinos in 1991, there are now 1,521 operating across the country (1). And this figure is only set to grow as Native American tribes open new establishments and existing venues expand their operations (2). With this level of competition, it’s no wonder that casino operators are always on the lookout for new ways to lure patrons through their doors - and one such method is marketing gambling as a form of recreation that can provide individuals with a sense of escapism and amusement.  This tactic seems to be working well; industry analysts report that gambling is becoming an increasingly popular pastime among Americans (3), with particular uptake occurring among those living in Southern states such as Indiana . </p>
<p> In 2017 , revenue from casinos located south of Indianapolis increased by 5 percent compared with the previous year , with earnings totaling nearly $1 . 2 billion . This accounted for nearly half of all casino revenue generated by Indiana’s 10 gambling establishments .  The primary drivers for this trend seem to be boredom and stress related to economic hardship : according Statesman Journal , “people living in poverty are more likely” than others “to experience stress and anxiety”, both of which are known precursors to pathological gambling behavior . </p>
<p> While it’s easy enough for casino executives and other vested interests to tout gambling as a harmless form of entertainment that can provide individuals with a much needed respite from everyday life , it’s important for us as a society take a step back and consider the potential consequences associated with such widespread adoption . Pathological or problem gambling can have serious negative consequences for both the individual gambler and their loved ones , including mental health issues , financial strife , and even criminal activity .  In light of these risks , it’s crucial that we exercise caution before blindly endorsing gambling as a means of escaping boredom or dealing with difficult life circumstances .</p>
