The game was initially created by Activision in 2003 and was later bought by Ubisoft in 2006. So, who actually owns the game now?</p>
<p>Well, as of 2019, Ubisoft still owns the rights to The Emperor’s Tomb game. They have not released any updates or new versions of the game in recent years, but that doesn’t mean they won’t in the future. It’s possible that they could release a new update or even a completely new game based on The Emperor’s Tomb.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a fan of this classic game, keep an eye out for any new announcements from Ubisoft. They may just surprise us all with a brand new release!</p>

The company owns and operates more than 40 casinos and resorts worldwide.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Jockey-Club-buys-Emperor’s-Tomb-Game"><a href="#Maryland-Jockey-Club-buys-Emperor’s-Tomb-Game" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Jockey Club buys Emperor’s Tomb Game"></a>Maryland Jockey Club buys Emperor’s Tomb Game</h1><p>The Maryland Jockey Club has announced that they have agreed to purchase the Emperor’s Tomb game from WMS Gaming. The game, which is a horse racing-themed video slot, is expected to be launched at the Mardigold casino in November.</p>
<p>“We are excited about the addition of Emperor’s Tomb to our gaming lineup,” said Tom Chuckas, president of the Maryland Jockey Club. “This game is a perfect fit for our customers and we believe it will be a big hit.”</p>
<p>The Emperor’s Tomb game is a 5-reel, 30-line video slot that features 243 ways to win. The game includes several bonus features, including a free spins bonus round, a scatter symbol and a wild symbol.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the Maryland Jockey Club has chosen our game for their casino,” said Richard Shimooka, senior director of marketing for WMS Gaming. “Emperor’s Tomb is one of our most popular games and we know it will be a hit at Mardigold.”</p>
<p>The Maryland Jockey Club owns and operates two casinos in Maryland – Mardigold and Rocky Gap Casino Resort – and plans to open a third casino in Baltimore in early 2016.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-giant-MGM-buys-Horseshoe-Casino-Baltimore"><a href="#Gaming-giant-MGM-buys-Horseshoe-Casino-Baltimore" class="headerlink" title="Gaming giant MGM buys Horseshoe Casino Baltimore"></a>Gaming giant MGM buys Horseshoe Casino Baltimore</h1><p>Casino gaming company MGM Resorts International has announced that it is buying the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore from Caesars Entertainment Corporation. The purchase price has not been released, but is rumoured to be in the region of $300 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition will give MGM a presence in Maryland, as well as in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, where it already owns properties. It will also add to the company’s already considerable portfolio of casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Horseshoe Casino Baltimore opened in 2014 and has a gaming floor of over 125,000 square feet, as well as restaurants, bars and a hotel. It is one of six casinos in Maryland, which generated over $1.5 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<p>“This acquisition adds another high-performing property to our growing portfolio and expands our presence in an important market,” said Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. “Baltimore is a vibrant city with a strong economy and we look forward to welcoming guests from the region to our properties nationwide.”</p>

But that all changed this week when the casino was sold to Rock Gaming, a company owned by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert.</p>
<p>The new ownership brings with it some big changes for the casino. For starters, the name will be changing to JACK Casino Baltimore. And there will also be a big focus on adding more table games and expanding the casino’s dining options.</p>
<p>While it’s still too early to know exactly what all the changes will entail, one thing is for sure - there’s going to be a lot of excitement in Baltimore’s gambling scene over the next few months!</p>
