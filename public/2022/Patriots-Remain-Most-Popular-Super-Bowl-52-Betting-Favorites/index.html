        <h1 id="Patriots-Remain-Most-Popular-Super-Bowl-52-Betting-Favorites"><a href="#Patriots-Remain-Most-Popular-Super-Bowl-52-Betting-Favorites" class="headerlink" title="Patriots Remain Most Popular Super Bowl 52 Betting Favorites"></a>Patriots Remain Most Popular Super Bowl 52 Betting Favorites</h1><p>The New England Patriots are heading into the Super Bowl as the favorites to win the game, according to the latest odds from sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.</p>
<p>Tom Brady and the Patriots are currently listed at -175 to win their sixth championship this year, with the Philadelphia Eagles coming in as +145 underdogs. The OVER&#x2F;UNDER for total points scored in the game is set at 48.5.</p>
<p>In spite of their underdog status, there has been no movement on the line for the Eagles over the past few days following their 38-7 rout of the Minnesota Vikings in Sunday’s NFC Championship Game. The action has been all one-way on the Patriots, who opened as a -165 favorite and have steadily seen that price climb.</p>
<p>The biggest play on New England so far may have come early in Sunday’s conference title games when a bettor put down $1 million on the Patriots to cover a 3-point spread against Jacksonville. That wager would net $180,000 if it hit.</p>
<p>Another big bet came later on Sunday when a gambler placed a $500,000 bet on Philly at +3 to bring home a potential payday of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The Patriots will be looking to add to their dynasty this year, while young quarterback Nick Foles will be hoping to lead Philadelphia to its first Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<h1 id="Eagles-Odds-Continue-to-Improve-Leading-Up-to-Super-Bowl-52"><a href="#Eagles-Odds-Continue-to-Improve-Leading-Up-to-Super-Bowl-52" class="headerlink" title="Eagles Odds Continue to Improve Leading Up to Super Bowl 52"></a>Eagles Odds Continue to Improve Leading Up to Super Bowl 52</h1><p>The Philadelphia Eagles have enjoyed a remarkable turnaround season, with their odds of winning Super Bowl 52 improving significantly in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Philadelphia was initially listed at 20-1 to win the Super Bowl, but their odds have shortened to just 12-1 as they prepare to take on the New England Patriots in Minnesota.</p>
<p>While the Eagles are still considered underdogs, their odds have improved dramatically since they started the season as one of the worst teams in the league.</p>
<p>Philadelphia’s success is largely due to the play of second-year quarterback Carson Wentz, who has emerged as one of the top stars in the NFL.</p>
<p>Wentz has thrown 33 touchdown passes this season and led the Eagles on a dramatic playoff run that included a win over the Atlanta Falcons in the divisional round.</p>
<p>Despite Wentz’s impressive play, many observers believe that Philadelphia’s chances of winning Super Bowl 52 hinge on their ability to stop Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.</p>
<p>Brady is looking for his sixth championship ring and is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.</p>
<p>If Philadelphia can limit Brady’s impact on the game, they have a chance to pull off an upset and win their first Super Bowl title.</p>
<h1 id="Steelers-Best-AFC-North-Team-in-Public-Betting"><a href="#Steelers-Best-AFC-North-Team-in-Public-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Steelers Best AFC North Team in Public Betting"></a>Steelers Best AFC North Team in Public Betting</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers are now the best AFC North team in public betting,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> as they have overtaken the Baltimore Ravens. The Steelers are now getting 52% of bets to win the division, while the Ravens are at 48%.</p>
<p>The Steelers have been on a roll recently, winning 5 out of their last 6 games. They currently have a record of 7-2-1 and sit in first place in the AFC North. The Ravens have been struggling recently, losing 3 out of their last 4 games. They currently have a record of 4-5 and sit in third place in the division.</p>
<p>The Bengals and Browns are both longshots to win the division, with odds of +1600 and +2500, respectively.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to bet on who will win the AFC North, the Steelers are your best option.</p>
<h1 id="49ers-Most-Popular-Wildcard-Team-in-Public-Betting"><a href="#49ers-Most-Popular-Wildcard-Team-in-Public-Betting" class="headerlink" title="49ers Most Popular Wildcard Team in Public Betting"></a>49ers Most Popular Wildcard Team in Public Betting</h1><p>The 49ers are the most popular wildcard team in public betting, according to a new report from Sports Insights.</p>
<p>San Francisco is currently receiving 58% of spread bets and 65% of total dollars wagered for their game against the Packers this weekend. The 49ers opened as 3-point underdogs, but the line has since shifted to Green Bay -3.5.</p>
<p>The Packers have received 42% of spread bets and 35% of total dollars wagered.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the 49ers have been favored this season. They are 2-4 ATS with three outright losses. San Francisco’s two wins came against the Buccaneers (27-9) and Bengals (34-16).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Packers are 5-1 SU and 4-2 ATS with two outright losses. Their only defeats came at the hands of the Rams (29-27) and Patriots (31-17).</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Finals-Warriors-a-Big-Favorite-Over-Cavs"><a href="#NBA-Finals-Warriors-a-Big-Favorite-Over-Cavs" class="headerlink" title="NBA Finals: Warriors a Big Favorite Over Cavs"></a>NBA Finals: Warriors a Big Favorite Over Cavs</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors are a big favorite over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. The Warriors are -260 favorites to win the series, while the Cavaliers are +220 underdogs.</p>
<p>Golden State cruised through the playoffs, going 12-1 en route to the Finals. The one loss came in Game 4 of their Western Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets. Golden State was down 3-2 in that series but won Games 6 and 7 to clinch their spot in the Finals.</p>
<p>Cleveland had a much tougher road to the Finals. They had to go through the Boston Celtics and then the Houston Rockets. The Cavaliers beat Boston in seven games, but they were trailing 3-2 in that series before winning the final three games. Cleveland then beat Houston in seven games as well, after being down 3-2 in that series as well.</p>
<p>The Warriors are coming into this series with a lot of momentum, while the Cavaliers are seemingly running on fumes. It’s hard to see Cleveland upsetting Golden State in this series.</p>
