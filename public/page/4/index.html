The first is affordable premiums. The second is a low deductible. The third is good coverage. The fourth is provider networks that you are comfortable with. The fifth is prescription drug coverage. The sixth is mental health coverage. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Affordable premiums: One of the most important factors to consider when looking for a health insurance plan is the cost of premiums. Make sure that the premiums are affordable and that you will be able to afford them on a monthly basis.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Low deductible: Another important factor to consider is the amount of the deductible. Make sure that the deductible is low so that you will not have to pay too much out-of-pocket in case of an emergency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Good coverage: Make sure that the plan has good coverage so you will be able to receive the care you need in case of an emergency or illness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provider networks: It is also important to make sure that the plan has a good network of providers so you will be able to see the doctors and hospitals you prefer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prescription drug coverage: Most plans offer prescription drug coverage, but make sure to check before enrolling. This can be an important benefit if you take medication regularly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mental health coverage: Finally, make sure that the plan offers mental health coverage. This can be an important benefit if you need treatment for mental health issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Why-are-the-6-Necessities-Of-A-Good-Health-Insurance-Plan-important"><a href="#Why-are-the-6-Necessities-Of-A-Good-Health-Insurance-Plan-important" class="headerlink" title="Why are the 6 Necessities Of A Good Health Insurance Plan important?"></a>Why are the 6 Necessities Of A Good Health Insurance Plan important?</h1><p>A good health insurance plan is important to have because it can help you pay for medical expenses that you may incur. The six necessities of a good health insurance plan are affordability, comprehensiveness, portability, predictability, stability, and versatility.</p>
<p>Affordability is important because you don’t want your health insurance premiums to be so high that you can’t afford them. Comprehensive coverage is important because you don’t want to be left paying for medical expenses out of pocket. Portability is important because you don’t want to lose your health insurance coverage if you switch jobs or move. Predictability is important because you don’t want your premiums or benefits to change suddenly. Stability is important because you don’t want your health insurance coverage to end unexpectedly. And finally, versatility is important because you want a plan that will cover a variety of medical expenses.</p>
<h1 id="Who-should-look-for-a-health-insurance-plan-that-includes-the-6-Necessities"><a href="#Who-should-look-for-a-health-insurance-plan-that-includes-the-6-Necessities" class="headerlink" title="Who should look for a health insurance plan that includes the 6 Necessities?"></a>Who should look for a health insurance plan that includes the 6 Necessities?</h1><p>You should look for a health insurance plan that includes the 6 Necessities if you are:</p>
<p>–Employed and not eligible for group coverage through your work<br>–Self-employed<br>–Underinsured<br>–Unemployed and not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare<br>–A student<br>–A senior citizen</p>
<p>The 6 Necessities are: preventive care, doctor visits, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, hospitalization, and emergency care.</p>
<p>If you do not have health insurance, you may be subject to fines under the Affordable Care Act. You can avoid these fines by obtaining health insurance that meets the minimum requirements of the law. These requirements are known as the 6 Necessities.</p>
<p>Most health insurance plans include all of the 6 Necessities. However, there are some exceptions. If you are self-employed or unemployed, you may need to purchase a separate policy that includes these benefits.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-someone-find-a-health-insurance-plan-that-includes-the-6-Necessities"><a href="#How-can-someone-find-a-health-insurance-plan-that-includes-the-6-Necessities" class="headerlink" title="How can someone find a health insurance plan that includes the 6 Necessities?"></a>How can someone find a health insurance plan that includes the 6 Necessities?</h1><p>There are many things that you need to think about when finding a health insurance plan. You want to find one that includes the 6 Necessities so that you know your health is always taken care of. Here are a few tips on how to find the best health insurance plan for you and your loved ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Review your current needs and make a list of the 6 Necessities:<br>-Regular checkups<br>-Preventive care<br>-Maternity care<br>-Emergency room visits<br>-Hospital stays<br>-Prescription drugs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decide what type of coverage you would like:<br>-Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) offer pre-set provider networks, which typically have lower costs but may limit your choice of doctors.<br>-Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) allow you to see any doctor within the network, but usually have higher premiums. 	-Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs) are like HMOs, except you cannot see any doctor outside of the network without paying extra.<br>-Point of Service (POS) plans are hybrids of HMOs and PPOs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>catastrophic or major medical insurance plans typically have low monthly premiums but high deductibles. They are only meant to cover major medical expenses, such as hospitalization or an accident. Be sure to read the fine print to make sure the plan covers what you need.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Compare different plans and rates: Websites like eHealthinsurance allow you to compare different health insurance plans and rates from different providers. You can also talk to an agent to help find the best plan for your needs. </li>
<li>Make sure the plan covers your current doctors: If you have a doctor that you prefer, be sure to check whether they are in the provider network for the plan you are considering. If they are not, you may have to pay extra fees every time you visit them.</li>
<li>Choose a plan that fits your budget: It is important to find a plan that fits your budget in addition to meeting your health needs. There is no point in choosing a plan that has expensive premiums if you cannot afford it month-to-month. Consider how much money you can realistically afford to spend on premiums each month.</li>
