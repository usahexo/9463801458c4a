<p>Virtus Bologna pulled off an upset victory over Juventus on Monday evening, topping the Turin side 92-86. The home team was led by former NBA player Brandon Jennings, who poured in a game-high 31 points.</p>
<p>“We played as a team and never gave up,” Jennings said after the game. “This is a great win for us.”</p>
<p>The loss was costly for Juventus, which saw its lead over second-place Napoli shrink to four points.</p>
<p>“We’re not happy with this loss,” said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. “But we’ll learn from it and move on.”</p>
<h1 id="Virtus-Bologna-Proves-Gambler’s-Odds-Wrong-Again"><a href="#Virtus-Bologna-Proves-Gambler’s-Odds-Wrong-Again" class="headerlink" title="Virtus Bologna Proves Gambler’s Odds Wrong Again"></a>Virtus Bologna Proves Gambler’s Odds Wrong Again</h1><p>A year ago, Virtus Bologna was a mess. The team had parted ways with coach Gianluca Guidi and star player Alessandro Gentile, and finished the 2016-2017 season in 15th place in the 16-team league. To add insult to injury, their first-round playoff exit triggered a clause in head coach Stefano Sacripanti’s contract that allowed him to leave for another team.</p>
<p>Owner Claudio Sabatini made a gamble by bringing back legendary head coach Andrea Mazzoncini - an all-time club great during his playing days - who had been out of coaching for several years. And with no marquee signings to speak of, Virtus entered the 2017-2018 season as an underdog.</p>
<p>But Mazzoncini has proved the odds wrong once again. After finishing the regular season in 7th place, Virtus upset 4th-seeded Sassari in the playoff quarterfinals, then beat 3rd-seeded Milano in the semifinals to earn their first trip to the Italian League Finals since 2007.</p>
<p>Their opponent in the Finals will be 5th-seeded Roma, which Virtus defeated 2 games to 1 during the regular season. If they can win one more game against Roma, Virtus will be crowned champions of Italy for the very first time.</p>
<p>So how has Virtus managed this remarkable turnaround? The answer is a combination of factors: a new head coach with a wealth of experience; young players who have stepped up their game; and gutsy decisions by management in the transfer market.</p>
<p>Sabatini recognized early on that he needed to bring in some new faces if Virtus were to compete for a championship. So he recruited former NBA player Danilo Gallinari, who has been a driving force behind their playoff run; along with experienced players like Achille Polonara and Riccardo Cervi.</p>
<p>But it hasn’t just been the veterans leading Virtus Bologna to success; several young players have also played pivotal roles. Point guard Pietro Aradori - who is just 26 years old - has averaged 14 points per game in the playoffs; while forwards Federico Mussini (21) and Filippo Baldi Rossi (22) have also contributed significantly.</p>
<p>The combination of youth and experience has been key for Virtus Bologna; as has their never-say-die attitude. They’ve shown plenty of heart throughout this playoff run, coming back from double digit deficits on multiple occasions. And that fighting spirit was on full display in their semifinal series against Milano, when they managed to win games 3 and 4 despite being down 2 games to 0.</p>
<p>Virtus Bologna may not be one of Italy’s traditional powerhouse teams, but they’ve certainly proven themselves worthy champions this season. And with Sabatini at the helm, they’ll definitely be contenders again next year - regardless of what the oddsmakers say</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Bettors-Miss-Out-on-a-Great-Opportunity-with-Virtus-Bologna"><a href="#Sports-Bettors-Miss-Out-on-a-Great-Opportunity-with-Virtus-Bologna" class="headerlink" title="Sports Bettors Miss Out on a Great Opportunity with Virtus Bologna"></a>Sports Bettors Miss Out on a Great Opportunity with Virtus Bologna</h1><p>The Virtus Bologna basketball team is having a great season in the Italian League. Bettors who are not following this team closely may be missing out on some good betting opportunities.</p>
<p>Virtus Bologna has a record of 14-4, which puts them in first place in their division. They have been very consistent this season, with only two losses in their past ten games. Virtus Bologna’s offence is led by Danilo Gallinari, who is averaging 17 points per game. The team also has a strong defence, which is allowing only 87 points per game.</p>
<p>Bettors who are looking for a good underdog bet should consider betting on Virtus Bologna. Their odds currently stand at 2.50 on Bet365. This means that a $100 bet would return $250 if Virtus Bologna wins.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Virtus-Bologna-Shock-the-Sports-World-Again"><a href="#Could-Virtus-Bologna-Shock-the-Sports-World-Again" class="headerlink" title="Could Virtus Bologna Shock the Sports World Again?"></a>Could Virtus Bologna Shock the Sports World Again?</h1><p>Could Virtus Bologna, an Italian basketball club, shock the sports world again?</p>
<p>This is a question that is on the minds of many sports fans around the world.</p>
<p>In March of 2018, Virtus Bologna stunned the sports world by defeating powerhouse FC Barcelona in the Champions League. This was an incredible upset, and it left many people wondering if Virtus Bologna could do it again.</p>
<p>Now, in May of 2019, Virtus Bologna has once again qualified for the Champions League. This time, they will be facing off against Real Madrid, one of the best clubs in the world.</p>
<p>Many people are predicting that Real Madrid will easily dispatch Virtus Bologna. However, nothing is ever a sure thing in sports, and there is always potential for an upset.</p>
<p>Virtus Bologna will certainly be underdogs going into this match-up against Real Madrid. However, they have already shown that they are capable of pulling off an upset. If they can play to their potential and surprise Real Madrid, then they could potentially shock the sports world again.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-on-Virtus-Bologna-You-May-Be-Lucky-Enough-to-Win"><a href="#Gambling-on-Virtus-Bologna-You-May-Be-Lucky-Enough-to-Win" class="headerlink" title="Gambling on Virtus Bologna? You May Be Lucky Enough to Win"></a>Gambling on Virtus Bologna? You May Be Lucky Enough to Win</h1><p>Gambling on Virtus Bologna basketball games may not be the smartest thing to do, but with a little bit of luck you could come out ahead.</p>
<p>The team has had a tough season so far, but they have shown signs of improvement in recent weeks. If you think they can pull off an upset against a more talented team, then gambling on them may be the way to go.</p>
<p>There is always some risk involved when gambling, but if you make a well-informed decision then there is no reason why you can’t win some money. Just make sure that you have done your research and are aware of the odds before placing any bets.</p>
<p>Virtus Bologna will be looking to pick up their first win of the season against Udinese on Sunday. The odds may not be in their favour, but stranger things have happened in basketball. With a bit of luck, you could end up winning some money by betting on Virtus Bologna.</p>
