#  Best Blackjack Tips from Rowan Atkinson

Actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson is a big fan of blackjack and has learned a lot about the game over the years. Here are some of his top tips for playing blackjack and winning.

1. Always be aware of the value of your cards.

The value of your cards is important to remember, especially when you are close to 21. For example, if you have an ace and a six, the overall value of your hand is seven, so you would want to hit if you were given the opportunity.

2. Don't be afraid to take risks.

While it's important to be mindful of the value of your cards, don't be afraid to take risks in order to win big. If you have a high card, go for it! Just make sure that you know when to stop if things start going poorly.

3. Don't let emotions get in the way.

It's important not to let emotions get in the way when playing blackjack. This means keeping a level head even when things aren't going well and being able to make sound decisions based on the information available to you.

#  Watch Out for These Blackjack Moves from Rowan Atkinson

In the movie "Casino Royale," actor Rowan Atkinson played a character named Edmund who was known as quite the card sharp -- and blackjack was his game. If you're looking to up your game at the casino table, below are three of Edmund's blackjack moves that you'll want to watch out for.

#1: The Slash

The slash is a move where you split your two cards into two different hands. For example, if you're dealt two eights, you would split them into two hands of four each. This move can be useful when you have two relatively low cards and you want to increase your chances of getting a good hand. Just be aware that if the dealer has an ace as their upcard, they will likely automatically take one of your cards in order to create a blackjack hand (which would lose you money).

#2: The Insurance Bet

The insurance bet is a move that can be helpful if you're worried about the dealer having a blackjack hand. When the dealer shows an ace as their upcard, players have the option of placing an insurance bet (usually equal to half of their initial bet). If the dealer then reveals a second ace, players will receive payments equaling their initial bet multiplied by 2 or 3 (depending on the casino). However, if the dealer doesn't have blackjack, players lose their insurance bets.

#3: The Double Down

The double down is a move where you can increase your bet after seeing your first two cards. This is typically done when your two cards are of equal value (e.g., two kings or two sixes). By doubling down, you're essentially betting that you'll get another good card and improve your hand. Just keep in mind that if you do end up winning with a double down, your payout will only be equal to your initial bet amount -- not twice as much as usual.

#  Could You Beat Rowan Atkinson at Blackjack?

It’s safe to say that most people wouldn’t be able to beat Rowan Atkinson at blackjack. The British actor and comedian is known for being an avid blackjack player, and he has allegedly won thousands of pounds playing the game.

But could you beat Rowan Atkinson? There’s only one way to find out – by giving it a try!

If you’re new to blackjack, here are some basic rules:

1. To begin the game, each player is dealt two cards. The object of the game is to achieve a hand total of 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

2. Card values are as follows: Aces count as either 1 or 11 points, 2-10 count as face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) count as 10 points.

3. If your first two cards add up to 21 (i.e. an Ace and a 10), you have a blackjack and automatically win the hand.

4. If your hand total exceeds 21, you ‘bust’ and lose the hand.

5. The player closest to 21 without going over wins the hand. In the event of a tie, the players ‘split’ and each receive another card face up, after which they must decide whether to stand (end their turn) or hit (take another card).




The basic strategy for blackjack is: always stand on 17 or more; always hit on 16 or less; double down on 11 against dealer's ace upcard; split 8s if dealer has Ace upcard; double down on 10 against dealer's Ace upcard provided player has 10 in original 2-card hand).  

Now that you know the basics, let’s take a look at how you might be able to beat Rowan Atkinson!
The first thing you need to do is memorize the basic strategy for blackjack – this will give you the best chance of winning at the game. Once you have a good understanding of how to play blackjack, you can start thinking about ways to improve your odds even further. For example, you could try splitting 8s if the dealer has an Ace upcard – this is something that Rowan Atkinson is known to do occasionally in order to increase his chances of winning.
Another thing you can do is use card counting methods when playing blackjack. This involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that you can make better decisions about when to hit or stand based on what’s left in the deck. Again, this is something that Rowan Atkinson is known for doing and it can give you a slight edge over the house if done correctly. 

So now that we know how to beat Rowan Atkinson at blackjack, it’s time to put our skills to the test! Good luck!
