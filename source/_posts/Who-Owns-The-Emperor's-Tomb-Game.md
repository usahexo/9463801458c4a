#  Who Owns The Emperor's Tomb Game?

The Emperor's Tomb game is one that has been around for years and many people have wondered who owns the rights to it. The game was initially created by Activision in 2003 and was later bought by Ubisoft in 2006. So, who actually owns the game now?

Well, as of 2019, Ubisoft still owns the rights to The Emperor's Tomb game. They have not released any updates or new versions of the game in recent years, but that doesn't mean they won't in the future. It's possible that they could release a new update or even a completely new game based on The Emperor's Tomb.

So, if you're a fan of this classic game, keep an eye out for any new announcements from Ubisoft. They may just surprise us all with a brand new release!
