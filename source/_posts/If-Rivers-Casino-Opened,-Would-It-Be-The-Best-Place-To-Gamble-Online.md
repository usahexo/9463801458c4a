#  Rivers Casino Could Soon Be The Best Place To Gamble In Pennsylvania

The Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, PA is getting a facelift, and when it reopens in the summer of 2019, it will be the best place to gamble in the state.

The casino is being renovated with a new 16-story tower that will add an additional 450 slots and table games to its current offering. It will also have a new bar, restaurant, and lounge on the 16th floor.

The Rivers Casino is already one of the biggest casinos in Pennsylvania, and this renovation will make it even bigger and better. If you're looking for a place to gamble in Pennsylvania, the Rivers Casino is your best bet.

#  Rivers Casino Likely To Offer The Best Slot Machines In Pennsylvania

As one of the most popular casinos in Pennsylvania, Rivers Casino is likely to offer the best slot machines in the state. With over 2,000 slot machines on site, players are sure to find the perfect game for them. From classic slots to progressives and everything in between, there’s something for everyone at Rivers Casino.

Plus, new releases are always being added to the lineup, so players can always enjoy the latest and greatest games. Whether you’re looking for a thrilling gaming experience or just want to relax with some classic slots, Rivers Casino is definitely worth checking out.

#  Could Rivers Casino Steal Gamblers Away From Casinos In Other States?

Pennsylvania has long been a Mid-Atlantic gambling hub. The state is home to 12 casinos, including the massive Philadelphia-area SugarHouse Casino and the newly opened Hollywood Casino in suburban Pittsburgh.

Now, a new player has entered the fray: Rivers Casino. The $310 million complex just across from Heinz Field, home of the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, held its grand opening Feb. 15.

The casino is owned by Rush Street Gaming, which also operates casinos in Chicago, New Jersey and Rhode Island.

So far, so good for Rivers Casino. It generated $16 million in gaming revenue during its first month of operation, according to state regulators. That was good enough for second place among Pennsylvania's casinos (behind only Parx Casino in suburban Philadelphia), and it appears that Rivers is siphoning off some business from its competitors in other states.

For years, Pennsylvania has been a relative backwater in the casino industry. But that could be changing now that Rivers Casino has opened its doors.

#  If Rivers Casino Opens, Will They be The First Casino in Pennsylvania With A Sportsbook?

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has been reviewing a license application from Rivers Casino for a $10 million sportsbook. The sportsbook would be the first in Pennsylvania if it is approved.

Rivers Casino submitted their license application in February and is now waiting for approval. There are already six casinos in Pennsylvania with licenses to offer sports betting, but Rivers Casino would be the first to have a physical sportsbook.

So far, the PGCB hasn't said much about the application. A spokeswoman said that it is under review and that there is no timeline for a decision.

Rivers Casino has been pushing for a sportsbook for awhile. Last year, they applied for an online license, but were denied. At the time, the PGCB said that they needed more information about the casino's plans for geolocation technology.

Now that Rivers Casino has submitted a license application for a physical sportsbook, it's likely that they will include more detailed information about their geolocation plans.

If approved, Rivers Casino would join several other casinos in Pennsylvania with sportsbooks. The state's first sports betting operation launched at Hollywood Casino in January. Since then, several other casinos have launched their own sportsbooks, including SugarHouse Casino, Parx Casino, and Valley Forge Casino Resort.
