#  Virtus Bologna Beats The Odds To Earn Victory Over Juventus

Bologna, Virtus – Monday, October 22, 2018

Virtus Bologna pulled off an upset victory over Juventus on Monday evening, topping the Turin side 92-86. The home team was led by former NBA player Brandon Jennings, who poured in a game-high 31 points.

"We played as a team and never gave up," Jennings said after the game. "This is a great win for us."

The loss was costly for Juventus, which saw its lead over second-place Napoli shrink to four points.

"We're not happy with this loss," said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. "But we'll learn from it and move on."

#  Virtus Bologna Proves Gambler's Odds Wrong Again

A year ago, Virtus Bologna was a mess. The team had parted ways with coach Gianluca Guidi and star player Alessandro Gentile, and finished the 2016-2017 season in 15th place in the 16-team league. To add insult to injury, their first-round playoff exit triggered a clause in head coach Stefano Sacripanti's contract that allowed him to leave for another team.

Owner Claudio Sabatini made a gamble by bringing back legendary head coach Andrea Mazzoncini - an all-time club great during his playing days - who had been out of coaching for several years. And with no marquee signings to speak of, Virtus entered the 2017-2018 season as an underdog.

But Mazzoncini has proved the odds wrong once again. After finishing the regular season in 7th place, Virtus upset 4th-seeded Sassari in the playoff quarterfinals, then beat 3rd-seeded Milano in the semifinals to earn their first trip to the Italian League Finals since 2007.

Their opponent in the Finals will be 5th-seeded Roma, which Virtus defeated 2 games to 1 during the regular season. If they can win one more game against Roma, Virtus will be crowned champions of Italy for the very first time.

So how has Virtus managed this remarkable turnaround? The answer is a combination of factors: a new head coach with a wealth of experience; young players who have stepped up their game; and gutsy decisions by management in the transfer market.

Sabatini recognized early on that he needed to bring in some new faces if Virtus were to compete for a championship. So he recruited former NBA player Danilo Gallinari, who has been a driving force behind their playoff run; along with experienced players like Achille Polonara and Riccardo Cervi.

But it hasn't just been the veterans leading Virtus Bologna to success; several young players have also played pivotal roles. Point guard Pietro Aradori - who is just 26 years old - has averaged 14 points per game in the playoffs; while forwards Federico Mussini (21) and Filippo Baldi Rossi (22) have also contributed significantly.

The combination of youth and experience has been key for Virtus Bologna; as has their never-say-die attitude. They've shown plenty of heart throughout this playoff run, coming back from double digit deficits on multiple occasions. And that fighting spirit was on full display in their semifinal series against Milano, when they managed to win games 3 and 4 despite being down 2 games to 0.

Virtus Bologna may not be one of Italy's traditional powerhouse teams, but they've certainly proven themselves worthy champions this season. And with Sabatini at the helm, they'll definitely be contenders again next year - regardless of what the oddsmakers say
