#  Only Us Says Where Sports Betting is Lawful

Sports betting is lawful in only some states in the USA. Each state has its own laws with regards to sports betting, and most of these laws are quite outdated. Delaware and Nevada are the two states where you will find fully legal sports betting. In states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, sports betting is sort of lawful. This means that in these states you can bet on sports, but only in certain areas or establishments. As for the majority of other states in America, it is illegal to place a wager on any type of sport event.

There are several reasons why sports betting is not legal nationwide in the United States. The first reason is that lawmakers feel that it could potentially lead to corruption within various sporting leagues. They are afraid that people within the sport industry could start to fix games in order to make more money off of bets. Additionally, many lawmakers believe that allowing people to bet on sports would cause an increase in gambling addiction rates. They feel that if people can place bets on virtually any sporting event, they will be more likely to gamble away all of their money on something as risky as sports betting.

Despite the fact that sports betting is not fully legal in America, there are still plenty of ways for people to get involved in this activity. There are numerous offshore websites where people can place bets on games, and there are also a number of physical casinos located in Delaware and Nevada where people can bet on sporting events in person. Additionally, there have been talks about legalizing sports betting nationwide over the past few years, so it is possible that this will eventually change. For now, though, each individual state gets to decide whether or not they want sports betting activity within their borders.

#  Only US States Can Legalize Sports Betting, For Now 

In May of this year, the United States Supreme Court overturned a federal law that prevented states from legalizing sports betting. The decision paves the way for individual states to legalize sports betting within their borders.

At the time of the Supreme Court’s ruling, only four states had laws in place that allowed for some form of legalized sports betting. In the months since the ruling, several more states have taken action to legalize sports betting.

Currently, only 16 states allow some form of legalized sports betting. Sixteen is a small number but there are many more states that are considering legalizing sports betting in the near future.

The map below shows which states have legalized sports betting and which states are considering it. The darker colors represent states where sports betting is currently legal and lighter colors represent states where legislation is pending or has been proposed.


The fact that only 16 states have so far legalized sports betting demonstrates that this is a complex issue with many factors to consider. There are pros and cons to legalizing sports betting and each state must weigh these factors before making a decision.

Some of the pros of legalizing sports betting include increased revenue for state governments, more jobs for people in the gaming industry, and increased tourism. Some of the cons include gambling addiction, corruption in sporting events, and negative effects on children.

It will be interesting to see how things play out over the next few years as more and more states legalize sports betting. It is clear that this is an issue that is gaining momentum and will continue to be a hot topic in the years ahead.

#  Nevada the Only State Allowed to Legalize Sports Betting 

On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that barred state-authorized sports betting, paving the way for legalized sports gambling across the country. The 6-3 ruling in favor of New Jersey overturns the ban that has been in place for more than two decades.

The majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito said that the federal law violated constitutional principles of state sovereignty and individual liberty. "The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make," Alito wrote. "Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own."

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was among the three dissenters, writing that the court's decision would reap financial rewards for casinos and lead to more compulsive gamblers. "The majority blithely ignores the fact that Congress' decision to prohibit state-sponsored sports betting was precisely tailored to protect innocent athletes and fans from the dangers of corruption and cheating," Ginsburg wrote.

After the ruling, shares of casino operators such as Caesars Entertainment Corp., MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd. rose sharply on Wall Street as investors bet that new revenue would be coming in from legalized sports betting. The American Gaming Association (AGA), a trade group representing the casino industry, estimates that Americans illegally wager about $150 billion on sports each year.

Most states have been waiting for a clear signal from the Supreme Court before moving forward with legislation to legalize sports betting within their borders. But one state has already taken advantage of the ruling: Nevada.

Nevada was exempted from the 1992 federal law because it had long allowed betting on sporting events. In light of Monday's ruling, Nevada lawmakers quickly moved to pass a bill allowing bets on athletic contests starting as soon as this weekend. Governor Brian Sandoval signed the measure into law on Thursday, making Nevada the only state currently authorized to offer legal sports betting.

Other states are expected to follow Nevada's lead, with some proposing legislation that would allow wagers on college games but exclude professional contests. It will likely be years before a national framework is in place for legalizing and regulating sports gambling nationwide.

#  New Jersey Moves to Allow Sports Betting, Despite Federal Opposition 

On Monday, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill allowing sports betting in the state, even though it is currently illegal under federal law. The move sets up a legal battle with the federal government, which is likely to try to block the law.

Supporters of the bill argue that sports betting is a form of entertainment, and should be legalized like other forms of gambling. They also say that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state.

Opponents of the bill, including the NFL and other professional sports leagues, argue that sports betting could lead to corruption and cheating. They also say that it would hurt the integrity of sporting events.

New Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting for years, but has been blocked by the federal government. In 2011, the US Supreme Court ruled that New Jersey could not legalize sports betting because it was contrary to federal law.

But with the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, things may be changing. Trump has shown support for legalizing sports betting, and his new Justice Department may not be as inclined to fight New Jersey’s efforts.

Even if New Jersey does manage to legalize sports betting, there are still some questions about how it will work. For example, will people be able to place bets online or in person? Will bets be limited to certain sporting events? And will there be any restrictions on who can place a bet?

It remains to be seen how this legal battle will play out, but one thing is for sure: there is a lot at stake for both sides.

#  Delaware LegalizesSports Betting on Proven Safe and Secure Platform

Delaware this week became the first state to legalize sports betting since a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to do so. Delaware’s move could pave the way for other states to follow suit.

The Delaware lottery will offer bets on NFL games starting Thursday, just days after Gov. John Carney signed a bill authorizing sports betting in the state. Delaware is already home to legal horse race betting and casino gambling.

While sports betting is now legal in Delaware, it will be offered through the state lottery's existing SportsBook app, which already offers bets on other sporting events such as college football and basketball games.

The move by Delaware comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in May struck down a 1992 federal law that barred most states from legalizing sports betting, prompting a rush by states to consider the move.

Some states are still waiting for regulations from sporting organizations such as the NBA and NFL before moving ahead with sports betting plans, but others are forging ahead without them, including Delaware.

Supporters of legalized sports betting say it would generate new tax revenue for states and create thousands of jobs, while opponents contend that it would lead to more organized crime and addiction problems.

John Stearns, a gaming analyst with Fitch Ratings, said that if every state were to legalize sports betting, it could generate up to $6 billion in annual revenue. But he cautioned that many states may not have the infrastructure in place to offer sports betting, and that there could be industry consolidation as a result.

"I think you're going to see some winners and losers," he said of states considering legalizing sports betting."You're going to have some states that get it right and offer good products and others that don't."
