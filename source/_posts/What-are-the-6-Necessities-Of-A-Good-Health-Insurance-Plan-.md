-Maternity care 
-Emergency room visits 
-Hospital stays 
-Prescription drugs

2) Decide what type of coverage you would like: 
-Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) offer pre-set provider networks, which typically have lower costs but may limit your choice of doctors. 
-Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) allow you to see any doctor within the network, but usually have higher premiums. 	-Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs) are like HMOs, except you cannot see any doctor outside of the network without paying extra. 
-Point of Service (POS) plans are hybrids of HMOs and PPOs. 
- catastrophic or major medical insurance plans typically have low monthly premiums but high deductibles. They are only meant to cover major medical expenses, such as hospitalization or an accident. Be sure to read the fine print to make sure the plan covers what you need. 
3) Compare different plans and rates: Websites like eHealthinsurance allow you to compare different health insurance plans and rates from different providers. You can also talk to an agent to help find the best plan for your needs. 
4) Make sure the plan covers your current doctors: If you have a doctor that you prefer, be sure to check whether they are in the provider network for the plan you are considering. If they are not, you may have to pay extra fees every time you visit them.
5) Choose a plan that fits your budget: It is important to find a plan that fits your budget in addition to meeting your health needs. There is no point in choosing a plan that has expensive premiums if you cannot afford it month-to-month. Consider how much money you can realistically afford to spend on premiums each month.
