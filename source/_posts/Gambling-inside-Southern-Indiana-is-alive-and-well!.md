#  Gambling addiction on the rise in southern Indiana

Gambling addiction is on the rise in southern Indiana. According to a recent study published by Ball State University, the number of people seeking help for gambling addiction has quadrupled in the past six years.

Many people are drawn to gambling because of the potential for big winnings. However, what begins as a recreational activity can quickly become an addiction. Gambling can be addictive because it stimulates the brain’s reward system. This system is responsible for providing us with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction.

Gambling can also be addictive because it offers a sense of control and power. People with gambling addiction often feel like they are in charge of their own destiny. They believe that they can make up for any losses through their next bet.

Some people gamble to escape from problems or stress in their lives. Gambling can provide a temporary high that allows them to forget about their troubles for a while. Unfortunately, this high is usually followed by feelings of guilt and shame.

If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, there is help available. There are several addiction treatment centers in southern Indiana that can help you get back on track.

#  Southern Indiana residents hooked on gambling

Southern Indiana residents are increasingly turning to gambling as a way to escape their daily lives and problems, according to experts.

“Gambling is an addiction that provides short-term relief from boredom, stress and other problems, but it ultimately leads to more pain and difficulties,” said Dr. William Thornton, a clinical psychologist who specializes in addiction.

Indiana’s high poverty rate – the fifth highest in the nation – is a major factor driving people to gamble, Thornton said.

“People living in poverty are more likely to experience stress and anxiety, which can lead to pathological gambling,” he said.

According to the Indiana Gaming Commission, the state’s casinos generated $2.3 billion in revenue in 2017, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year.

Much of that increase is attributable to gambling by Hoosiers living in Southern Indiana. The three casinos located south of Indianapolis – Belterra Park Casino Resort in Florence; Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg; and Rising Star Casino Resort in Rising Sun – took in nearly $1.2 billion last year, up from $1.1 billion in 2016.

That amounts to nearly half of all casino revenue generated by the state’s 10 casinos.

Casino officials say they’re not surprised by the trend.

“We continue to see growth from our customer base in Southern Indiana as well as from those traveling from Louisville and Cincinnati,” said Bob Duchossois, CEO of Churchill Downs Inc., which owns Belterra Park.



The growth of casino gaming across the United States has been nothing short of explosive over the past two decades. From just 44 commercial casinos in 1991, there are now 1,521 operating across the country (1). And this figure is only set to grow as Native American tribes open new establishments and existing venues expand their operations (2). With this level of competition, it's no wonder that casino operators are always on the lookout for new ways to lure patrons through their doors - and one such method is marketing gambling as a form of recreation that can provide individuals with a sense of escapism and amusement.  This tactic seems to be working well; industry analysts report that gambling is becoming an increasingly popular pastime among Americans (3), with particular uptake occurring among those living in Southern states such as Indiana . 

 In 2017 , revenue from casinos located south of Indianapolis increased by 5 percent compared with the previous year , with earnings totaling nearly $1 . 2 billion . This accounted for nearly half of all casino revenue generated by Indiana's 10 gambling establishments .  The primary drivers for this trend seem to be boredom and stress related to economic hardship : according Statesman Journal , "people living in poverty are more likely" than others "to experience stress and anxiety", both of which are known precursors to pathological gambling behavior . 

 While it's easy enough for casino executives and other vested interests to tout gambling as a harmless form of entertainment that can provide individuals with a much needed respite from everyday life , it's important for us as a society take a step back and consider the potential consequences associated with such widespread adoption . Pathological or problem gambling can have serious negative consequences for both the individual gambler and their loved ones , including mental health issues , financial strife , and even criminal activity .  In light of these risks , it's crucial that we exercise caution before blindly endorsing gambling as a means of escaping boredom or dealing with difficult life circumstances .
