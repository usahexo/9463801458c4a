#  Tanzania becomes a gambling powerhouse as casinos and betting firms flock to set up shop!

Tanzania is quickly becoming a gambling powerhouse as more and more casinos and betting firms set up shop in the country. The opening of new casinos has drawn large crowds, with people eager to take a chance on their luck.

One of the biggest draws for gamblers is the fact that Tanzania offers some of the best odds in Africa. This is thanks to the lack of restrictions on gambling, which has allowed casino operators to offer a range of games and betting options.

In addition to casinos, there are also numerous sports betting firms operating in Tanzania. These firms have seen rapid growth in recent years, as locals look to place bets on everything from football matches to horse races.

The influx of gambling companies has generated much-needed revenue for Tanzania's government. In fact, the gambling industry is now worth an estimated $1.5 billion annually, making it one of the country's most lucrative sectors.

While there are some concerns about the social impact of gambling, most experts agree that the benefits outweigh the risks. Gambling can generate much-needed jobs and revenue for local communities, while also providing entertainment for residents.

So far, the gambling industry has had a positive impact on Tanzania's economy. With continued growth predicted, it looks like Tanzania will remain a key player in Africa's gambling market for many years to come!

#  Gambling income offers major boost to Tanzania's economy 

Gambling has become a key contributor to Tanzania's economy in recent years, with revenues from the sector reaching an estimated $330 million in 2018. The country's players gambled away more than $2.3 billion last year, making it one of the top 20 gambling markets in the world.

This is a major turnaround for Tanzania, which only legalized gambling in 2006 and saw little activity in the early years. Betting companies have since mushroomed, with around 30 now operating in the country. The firms offer a wide range of betting options, including sports betting, casino games and lotteries.

The growth of gambling has been driven by Tanzanians' love of risk, as well as the availability of new technologies that make it easier to place bets. Gambling is particularly popular among young people, who account for more than half of all bets placed.

The rise of gambling has generated significant tax revenue for the government, which collected $100 million in taxes from the sector last year. This represents a major boost to Tanzania's economy, and is likely to increase further as gambling grows in popularity.

The benefits of gambling extend beyond taxation, as the industry also creates jobs and supports other businesses such as transport and hospitality. In total, gambling is estimated to support around 400,000 jobs in Tanzania.

The growth of gambling presents some risks, however, as it can lead to addiction and financial problems for players. The government is therefore keen to regulate the industry to ensure that it benefits society as a whole.

Overall, Tanzania's growing gambling industry presents a major opportunity for economic development. Its citizens are enjoying a better quality of life thanks to the jobs and tax revenue created by the sector, and there is scope for even more growth in the future.

#  Tanzania declares First International Casino Hub 

The United Republic of Tanzania, one of the countries in Africa has recently announced that it will be developing a gaming and entertainment hub in the country. The proposed area for this project is the city of Bagamoyo which is located on the coast. The Tanzanian government has partnered with a group of international investors to make this happen.

The development is expected to include a casino complex, a luxury hotel, an entertainment center, and a shopping mall. It is hoped that this development will create thousands of jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the country. Construction on the project is expected to begin in 2019 and be completed by 2022.

This development comes as good news for Tanzania as it looks to diversify its economy away from agriculture. The country faces some challenges such as high unemployment rates and poverty levels. The gaming and entertainment hub is expected to bring in $173 million annually to the country.

The Tanzanian government has not been without its controversies however. In 2017, President John Magufuli made headlines when he fired several top ministers who were accused of corruption. There have also been reports of human rights abuses under his administration.

#  Major gaming companies eyeing up Tanzania as their new gambling destination 

In a move that could see Tanzania become a leading gambling destination in Africa, several major gaming companies are reported to be eyeing up the country for investment.

According to a report in the 'East African', representatives from some of the world's biggest gaming companies have been meeting with government officials in Dar es Salaam to discuss potential investment opportunities.

 Among those said to be interested are Caesars Entertainment Corporation – which owns casinos across North America and Europe – and Las Vegas Sands Corporation, one of the largest casino operators in the world.

Both companies are understood to be keen on setting up large-scale resorts that would offer a range of gambling options, including slots, table games and sports betting.

This is not the first time that Tanzania has been mooted as a potential gambling hotspot; last year, Malaysian gaming company Genting Group announced plans to invest US$2 billion in a new integrated casino resort near Dar es Salaam. However, no progress has been made on that project so far.

Tanzania is seen as an attractive destination for gaming companies thanks to its large population (over 50 million), growing economy and strategic location on the continent. In addition, gambling is already popular in the country; according to reports, over $1.5 billion was wagered on sports betting alone in 2017.

With Africa's rapidly expanding middle class fuelling demand for leisure activities such as gambling, it is likely that more gaming companies will look to invest in Tanzania in the coming years. This could make the country a key player on the African gambling scene – and provide a much-needed boost to its tourism sector.
