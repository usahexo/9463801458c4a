#  Gambling license in Colorado costs $1,000

The gambling industry is one that is heavily regulated, and in order to get a license to operate a casino or gaming site in Colorado, you’ll need to dish out $1,000.

This fee is just the start, as there are many other regulations that you’ll need to adhere to if you want to run a gambling business in Colorado. For example, all of your employees will need to be licensed by the state, and you’ll be required to pay taxes on your gambling income.

Furthermore, any gaming site in Colorado must use geolocation technology to ensure that players are only gambling within the state. This is one of the reasons why so few online casinos are actually based in Colorado – it’s simply not worth the hassle for operators.

If you do want to operate a gambling business in Colorado, then you’ll need to make sure that you familiarize yourself with all of the relevant regulations. The good news is that the Colorado Division of Gaming has put together a comprehensive guide which outlines everything you need to know.
