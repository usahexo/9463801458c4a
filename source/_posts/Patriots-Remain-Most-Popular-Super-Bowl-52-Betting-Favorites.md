#  Patriots Remain Most Popular Super Bowl 52 Betting Favorites

The New England Patriots are heading into the Super Bowl as the favorites to win the game, according to the latest odds from sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.

Tom Brady and the Patriots are currently listed at -175 to win their sixth championship this year, with the Philadelphia Eagles coming in as +145 underdogs. The OVER/UNDER for total points scored in the game is set at 48.5.

In spite of their underdog status, there has been no movement on the line for the Eagles over the past few days following their 38-7 rout of the Minnesota Vikings in Sunday's NFC Championship Game. The action has been all one-way on the Patriots, who opened as a -165 favorite and have steadily seen that price climb.

The biggest play on New England so far may have come early in Sunday's conference title games when a bettor put down $1 million on the Patriots to cover a 3-point spread against Jacksonville. That wager would net $180,000 if it hit.

Another big bet came later on Sunday when a gambler placed a $500,000 bet on Philly at +3 to bring home a potential payday of $1.5 million.

The Patriots will be looking to add to their dynasty this year, while young quarterback Nick Foles will be hoping to lead Philadelphia to its first Vince Lombardi Trophy.

#  Eagles Odds Continue to Improve Leading Up to Super Bowl 52

The Philadelphia Eagles have enjoyed a remarkable turnaround season, with their odds of winning Super Bowl 52 improving significantly in the past few weeks.

Philadelphia was initially listed at 20-1 to win the Super Bowl, but their odds have shortened to just 12-1 as they prepare to take on the New England Patriots in Minnesota.

While the Eagles are still considered underdogs, their odds have improved dramatically since they started the season as one of the worst teams in the league.

Philadelphia’s success is largely due to the play of second-year quarterback Carson Wentz, who has emerged as one of the top stars in the NFL.

Wentz has thrown 33 touchdown passes this season and led the Eagles on a dramatic playoff run that included a win over the Atlanta Falcons in the divisional round.

Despite Wentz’s impressive play, many observers believe that Philadelphia’s chances of winning Super Bowl 52 hinge on their ability to stop Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

Brady is looking for his sixth championship ring and is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.

If Philadelphia can limit Brady’s impact on the game, they have a chance to pull off an upset and win their first Super Bowl title.

#  49ers Most Popular Wildcard Team in Public Betting

The 49ers are the most popular wildcard team in public betting, according to a new report from Sports Insights.

San Francisco is currently receiving 58% of spread bets and 65% of total dollars wagered for their game against the Packers this weekend. The 49ers opened as 3-point underdogs, but the line has since shifted to Green Bay -3.5.

The Packers have received 42% of spread bets and 35% of total dollars wagered.

Meanwhile, the Packers are 5-1 SU and 4-2 ATS with two outright losses. Their only defeats came at the hands of the Rams (29-27) and Patriots (31-17).

#  NBA Finals: Warriors a Big Favorite Over Cavs

The Golden State Warriors are a big favorite over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. The Warriors are -260 favorites to win the series, while the Cavaliers are +220 underdogs.

Golden State cruised through the playoffs, going 12-1 en route to the Finals. The one loss came in Game 4 of their Western Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets. Golden State was down 3-2 in that series but won Games 6 and 7 to clinch their spot in the Finals.

Cleveland had a much tougher road to the Finals. They had to go through the Boston Celtics and then the Houston Rockets. The Cavaliers beat Boston in seven games, but they were trailing 3-2 in that series before winning the final three games. Cleveland then beat Houston in seven games as well, after being down 3-2 in that series as well.

The Warriors are coming into this series with a lot of momentum, while the Cavaliers are seemingly running on fumes. It’s hard to see Cleveland upsetting Golden State in this series.
