#  Dean Cain Could Earn Up to $125,000 as a Blackjack Dealer in Las Vegas 

Dean Cain, who is best known for his role as Superman in the popular TV series "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman," could be making much more than he did as an actor now that he's a blackjack dealer in Las Vegas. 

Dealers typically earn between $50,000 and $125,000 per year in Sin City, and with Cain's skills at the table, it's likely that he'll fall into the upper range of that pay scale. 

Cain has been dealing since 2017 and has worked at several different casinos on the Strip, including Planet Hollywood, The Mirage and Caesars Palace. He was even featured on an episode of "The Card Player" poker show back in 2017. 

In an interview with the Las Vegas Sun last year, Cain said that he enjoys dealing because it's a lot like acting. "It's more interactive than acting," he said. "You're constantly engaging with people." 

Cain is currently appearing in the TV series "Hit The Floor" and also does occasional appearances on other shows as well as personal appearances. It's not clear how much demand there is for his services as a blackjack dealer, but it's safe to say that he won't be needing to take any day jobs anytime soon.

#  Dean Cain Could Net Over $1 Million as a Blackjack Dealer in Sin City 

With the legal gambling age in Las Vegas set at 21, it's no wonder that many celebrities flock to the city in order to partake in some blackjack action. And given that the minimum bet at most tables is $10, even relatively minor players can end up winning or losing big.

But for actor Dean Cain, a steady $1 million payday from blackjack seems within reach. According to one report, Cain was observed playing blackjack at the luxurious Bellagio casino for upwards of 12 hours per day during a recent trip to Sin City.

While his strategy is unknown, gambling experts suggest that Cain is likely betting big and relying on a little bit of luck to help him come out ahead. With a net worth estimated at around $16 million, Cain could certainly afford to lose a few hands – but if he continues his current streak, he could walk away with a nice chunk of change.

OTHER CELEBRITIES WHO LOVE BLACKJACK 
While Dean Cain may be the latest celebrity to hit the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, he's by no means the only one. In fact, some of the world's top athletes and entertainers are known for their love of card games – and blackjack in particular. 

 poker players like Phil Ivey and Antonio Esfandiari; NBA stars including Stephen Curry and Dwyane Wade; as well as singers such as Celine Dion and Elton John have all been known to enjoy a game or two (or ten) of blackjack when they're in town.
