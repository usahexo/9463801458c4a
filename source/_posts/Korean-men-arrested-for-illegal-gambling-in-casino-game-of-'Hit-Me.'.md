#  Korean men arrested for illegal gambling in casino game of 'Hit Me.'

According to police, the men were playing a casino game called 'Hit Me' at the time of their arrest. The game involved each player betting money on whether they could correctly guess the next number in a sequence. If they guessed correctly, they doubled their bet; if they guessed incorrectly, they lost everything.

In this instance, the men had allegedly been betting large sums of money, and had been playing for several hours before being arrested. Police believe that the men were not just gambling for fun, but were actually trying to make a profit by correctly predicting the numbers.

The arrests come as part of a wider crackdown on illegal gambling in South Korea. In recent months, police have been targeting casinos and other venues in which gambling is known to take place. So far, they have arrested over 1,000 people for gambling offences.

Casinos are legal in South Korea, but only foreigners are allowed to gamble there. Domestic residents are forbidden from playing at casinos, meaning that all forms of gambling in South Korea are technically illegal. However, this law is rarely enforced, and most Koreans participate in some form of gambling without fear of punishment.

#  What is the Korean Casino Game of 'Hit Me'?

The Korean casino game of 'Hit Me' is a Blackjack variant that is very popular in the country. The objective of the game is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player beats the dealer if their total is higher.

To play, the player first places an initial bet. They are then dealt two cards, face up. The dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down. The player then has the option to either hit (draw another card) or stand (hold their current total). If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose the bet. If the dealer busts, all players still in the hand win even money on their bets.

If both the player and dealer have identical totals (e.g. 17), this is called a 'push' and no money changes hands. In order to win, the player must beat the dealer's total, not simply have a higher total than them.

#  How to Play the Korean Casino Game of 'Hit Me' 

This game is popular in South Korea and can be played with two or more people. 

To play, each player is given a certain number of cards, usually between five and seven. The object of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. The first player to do so begins the next round.

The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by playing any card from their hand. The next player then plays a card, following either the rank or suit of the first card played. If they cannot play a card, they must pick up one from the deck and add it to their hand. When a player plays their last card, they are out of the round. The other players then take turns playing one more card until there are no cards left in their hand. The last player left in the round then takes all of the cards played and starts the next round.

The winner is the first player to lose all their cards.

The game of Hit Me is a popular Korean casino game that is often played illegally. The game can be played with any number of players, but it is most commonly played with two. One player is chosen to be the dealer and the other players are the players. The dealer deals four cards to each player, face down. The cards are dealt one at a time. After the four cards are dealt, the players look at their cards and make three piles: a high pile, a low pile, and a middle pile. The player to the dealers left starts by choosing one of their cards to put in their high pile. The card in the high pile must be higher than the card in the low pile and lower than the card in the middle pile. If they cannot put the card in their high pile, then they put it in their low pile. If they cannot do either of those, then they put it in their middle pile. The next player then does the same thing with one of their cards. If one of their cards is already in a high or low pile, then they just choose a different card to put in that pile. The goal is to get all of your cards into either the high or low piles. When all of the players have done this, the dealer turns over their four cards and does the same thing with them. The highest card in each of the four piles wins that round and takes all of the cards from those piles. Play then continues with each player drawing another card from the deck and making three new piles (high, low, and middle). 

The Korean Casino Game of 'Hit Me' can be won by knowing which cards to play when. In general, you want to try and get as many of your cards into either your high or low piles as possible. You also want to avoid putting any cards into your middle pile if possible. There are certain times when you will want to put a card into your middle pile though. For example, if you have two 4s in your hand, you would want to put one 4 into your high pile and one 4 into your low pile so that you don't end up losing both rounds if someone else has a higher card than you in those piles. You can also use your middle pile as a way to block other players from winning if they have a higher card than you in their high or low piles. 

One strategy for winning at Hit Me is called "the snake." The snake strategy is when you put all but one of your lowcards into your middlepile so that no matter what happens with those remaining two cards-one will always be higher than whatever's left inyour opponents' Low Pile-forcing them tobet even whenthey may not wantto (or cant) givingyouanadvantage without having tomove anytiles yourself!
