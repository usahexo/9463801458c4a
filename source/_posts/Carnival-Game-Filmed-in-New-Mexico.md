#  Where was Carnival Game filmed?

Carnival Game was filmed in the small town of Athol, Idaho. This was a great choice for the film as it allowed for a tight-knit community feel to be captured on camera. The townspeople were excited to have the opportunity to be involved in a movie, and many of them had small roles in the film.

One of the primary reasons that Athol was chosen as the filming location was due to the fact that it possessed a large and well-maintained park. This would be perfect for the carnival scenes that were required in the movie. In addition, there were several buildings in Athol which could serve as backdrops for different parts of the story.

The cast and crew of Carnival Game spent several weeks filming in Athol. During this time, they made good use of the town's resources and got to know the locals well. The people of Athol welcomed them with open arms and were excited to see their town featured on the big screen.

The film premiered in August of 2017 and has been well-received by audiences. It is clear that Carnival Game was filmed in the right place - thanks to the wonderful community of Athol, Idaho!

#  Carnival Game films in scenic New Mexico

A carnival is a festive celebration, usually held in autumn or winter, marked by rides, games, music, and food. Carnival game films are often set in picturesque locations, and New Mexico is no exception.

The first movie to film at the fairgrounds in Albuquerque was The Grapes of Wrath (1940), directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell. A scene near the beginning of the movie was shot at the carnival midway; one can see the Santa Fe Railroad depot in the background.

More recently, No Country for Old Men (2007), directed by Joel and Ethan Coen and starring Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones, was filmed at the State Fair in Albuquerque. Some of the fair scenes were shot at night under arc lights, giving them a surreal quality.

Another carnival game film set partly in New Mexico is La Bamba (1987), directed by Luis Valdez and starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Rosanna DeSoto. The story of Chicano rock legend Ritchie Valens is set against the backdrop of 1950s Southern California and features several scenes filmed at the New Mexico State Fair in Albuquerque.

These are just a few examples of movies that have been filmed at carnivals in New Mexico. As one can see, these festive celebrations provide an opportunity for filmmakers to capture scenic beauty that enhances their stories.
